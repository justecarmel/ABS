we describe a method used for extracting aspects in comments made by users on Cameroonian restaurants and assess the feelings carried out on these aspects. This work allowed us to identify the specificities related to Cameroonian restaurants such as feelings about local dishes such as Kwem, Achu, ndole, okok, Shawamar etc. The bilingual nature (French and English) associated with some local words of the comments made on Cameroonian restaurants requires that cross-lingual be taken into account in the process of extracting aspects on the one hand and polarizing these aspects on the other.
